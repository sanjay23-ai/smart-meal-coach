# Upload Project to GitHub - Quick Guide

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click the **"+"** icon → **"New repository"**
3. Repository name: `smart-meal-coach` (or any name you like)
4. Description: "AI-powered nutrition tracking system using computer vision"
5. Choose **Public** or **Private**
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Initialize Git and Push

Open terminal/PowerShell in your project folder and run:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "C:\Users\K sanjay\Downloads\computervision"

# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit files
git commit -m "Initial commit: Smart Meal Coach - AI nutrition tracking system"

# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/smart-meal-coach.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Upload

1. Go to your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your files there
3. The README.md will display automatically

## What Gets Uploaded

✅ **Included:**
- All source code (`src/`)
- Training scripts
- Documentation (README.md, guides)
- Requirements.txt
- Configuration files

❌ **Excluded (via .gitignore):**
- Virtual environment (`venv/`)
- Python cache (`__pycache__/`)
- Model files (optional - uncomment in .gitignore if you want to exclude)
- Data/images (optional - uncomment in .gitignore if you want to exclude)

## Optional: Add Model Files

If you want to include your trained model:

1. Edit `.gitignore`
2. Comment out or remove these lines:
   ```
   # models/*.pt
   # models/*.pth
   ```
3. Run `git add models/` and commit

## Optional: Add Sample Data

If you want to include sample images (be careful with file sizes):

1. Edit `.gitignore`
2. Comment out: `# data/images/`
3. Add only a few sample images (GitHub has file size limits)
